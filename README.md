# dRUBToken - Decentralized Russian Ruble on Ethereum :money_with_wings: :globe_with_meridians:

Welcome to the `dRUBToken` GitHub repository! This Solidity project is all about bringing the Russian Ruble into the decentralized world of Ethereum. :rocket: :earth_africa:

## What is dRUBToken? :thinking:
`dRUBToken` is a smart contract on Ethereum that represents a decentralized version of the Russian Ruble (dRUB). It's an ERC20 token with added functionalities to handle minting, burning, and token-to-Ethereum exchanges. :fire: :moneybag:

## Features :star2:
- **ERC20 Compliance**: Fully compliant with the ERC20 standard, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of wallets and exchanges. :heavy_check_mark:
- **Ownable**: Secure and manageable by the contract owner. :lock:
- **Mintable & Burnable**: dRUB can be minted or burned, providing flexibility in supply management. :factory: :fire:
- **Exchange with Ethereum**: Exchange dRUB with Ethereum at pre-defined rates, making it easy to convert between the two. :arrows_counterclockwise:

## Quick Start :runner:
